# Optimizing-Patient-Transport-A-Lean-Six-Sigma-Case-Study
Inefficiencies in patient transport at a hospital led to delays and dissatisfaction. Using Lean Six Sigma, the plan aims to digitalize and cut trip times from 46 to 28 minutes, boosting efficiency by 42%.

- Background & Problem Statement:

The hospital is facing issues with unreliable patient transportation, impacting satisfaction and operational efficiency.
The goal is to reduce the average trip time from 46 minutes to 28 minutes, addressing the primary causes of delays.

- Process Mapping & Identification of Issues:

Detailed mapping shows nine main roadblocks in transportation, including unavailable wheelchairs, occupied elevators, and unresponsive transportation desks.
A Cause-and-Effect diagram highlights these inefficiencies, underlining the high manual dependency in the process.

- DMAIC Approach Overview:

The team follows the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) Lean Six Sigma methodology.
Steps involve defining the problem, measuring current trip times, analyzing bottlenecks, and suggesting improvements.

- Proposed Digital Platform:

Replacing phone-based booking with a digital platform will allow streamlined scheduling and tracking, color-coded equipment allocation, and automated notifications for all stakeholders.
The system will assign tasks using a FIFO (First In, First Out) method, reducing randomness and delays.

- Storyboard and Interface Design:

A storyboard outlines the process flow, from patient readiness alerts to automated form submissions.
The interface design for staff ensures clear scheduling and equipment availability and minimizes errors.

- Control and Monitoring System:

Proposed control mechanisms include real-time monitoring of transfers and tracking metrics like response time, equipment availability, and patient satisfaction.
Contingency plans for technical issues and staff training ensure smooth adaptation.

- Benefits and Efficiency Gains:

The expected efficiency gain is 42%, reducing average trip time significantly.
Tangible benefits: reduced time and costs, better resource allocation.
Intangible benefits: improved staff morale, enhanced patient experience, and strengthened hospital reputation.

- Conclusion:

Implementing this digitalized approach is projected to streamline patient transportation, increase satisfaction, and optimize resources, supporting the hospital's operational goals.
